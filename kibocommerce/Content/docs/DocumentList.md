# DocumentList

A container for documents and related settings, such as supported documentTypes and publishing.   A documentList belongs to a Mozu context, denoted by the documentList scopyeType and scopeId fields.   Example: documentList A belongs to catalog 123, denoted by the documentList scopeType value of catalog and scopeId value of 123.  A documentList can only be accessed if the API context is inclusive of the documentList's scope.  Example: documentList A belongs to catalog 123. An API call with an API context of catalog 123 will be able to address documentList A.  Example: site 456 uses catalog 123. An API call with an API context of site 456 will be able to address documentList A.  Example: masterCatalog 789 is the parent of catalog 123. An API call with an API context of masterCatalog 789 will NOT be able to address documentList A.  Documents can be created, queried, managed and published from within a documentList. A documentList may be directly created, or indirectly created from a documentListType.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**name** | **String** | The name component of the listFQN, name@namespace. The name must be unique within the namespace component and cannot be updated.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType. |  [optional] |
|**namespace** | **String** | The namespace component of the listFQN, name@namespace. The issued dev account namespace must be used unless elevated privileges allow a blank namespace to be used. The namespace cannot be updated.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType. |  [optional] |
|**listFQN** | **String** | The unique identifier of the documentList, represented by name@namespace. The listFQN must be provided when creating the documentList, or the name and namespace fields must be provided.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType. |  [optional] |
|**documentTypes** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | An array of the full names (name@namespace) of the documentTypes supported by the documentList. A document in the documentList must belong to one of these documentTypes.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType. DocumentTypes can be added/removed to the documentList, even when  based on a documentListType. Existing documents that belong to a documentType removed from the documentList will not be removed. |  [optional] |
|**supportsPublishing** | **Boolean** | Determines if the documentList will support drafting and publishing documents.   This field defaults to false and cannot be updated.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType. |  [optional] |
|**enablePublishing** | **Boolean** | Determines if the documentList has publishing turned on or off. If the documentList has a supportsPublishing value of true, then the enablePublishing value will be honored.  If enablePublishing is true, then a document draft will be created for a document create or update operation. A document must then be published to become \&quot;active\&quot;.  If enablePublish is false, then all document changes are immediately \&quot;active\&quot;.  If enablePublish is true, then updating it to false will immediately publish all draft changes.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType, but can be overridden on update. |  [optional] |
|**supportsActiveDateRanges** | **Boolean** | Determines if the documentList will support ranges of dates that documents are considered &#39;active&#39;.   This field defaults to false and cannot be updated.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType. |  [optional] |
|**enableActiveDateRanges** | **Boolean** | Determines if the documentList has ActiveDateRanges turned on or off. If the documentList has a supportsActiveDateRanges value of true, then the enableActiveDateRanges value will be honored.  If enableActiveDateRanges is true, then a document will only be returned if the request is made within the time frame the document has been set to be &#39;active&#39;.  If enableActiveDateRanges is false, then the properties can be set but will not be honored.  If enableActiveDateRanges is true, then updating it to false will immediately start honoring the previously-set date range.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType, but can be overridden on update. |  [optional] |
|**views** | [**List&lt;View&gt;**](View.md) | An array of one or more views, which each allow GET access to a projection of fields from the documents in the given documentList.   If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType. Views can be added/removed to the documentList, even when  the documentList derives from a documentListType. |  [optional] |
|**usages** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | An array of strings that describes to the Mozu platform the manner(s) in which a documentList can be used. The following values are valid:  entitymanager -- the documentList should be visible in the Admin Content/Entities UI, which allows admin users to create, manage and publish documents within the documentList.  sitebuilder -- the documentList should be visible in Site Builder. A documentList will display in the Site Builder Navigation Content List node, which supports document creation, management and web cms integration.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType. Usages can be added or removed from the documentList, even when the documentList derives from a  documentListType. |  [optional] |
|**security** | **String** | tbd |  [optional] |
|**scopeId** | **Integer** | Used in conjunction with the scopeType field to determine the exact context within which the documentList resides.  Example: A documentList with a scopeId of 5 and scopeType of masterCatalog belongs to masterCatalog 5.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType. This value is read-only after the documentList is created. |  [optional] |
|**scopeType** | **String** | The context level the documentList resides in. Valid values are \&quot;tenant\&quot;, \&quot;masterCatalog\&quot;, \&quot;catalog\&quot; and \&quot;site\&quot;. This field is used in conjunction with the scopeId field  to determine the exact context within which this documentList resides. This field is read-only after insert.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType. This value is read-only after the documentList is created. |  [optional] |
|**documentListType** | **String** | The full name of the documentListType (name@namespace) that underlies the documentList. This value is only populated when the Mozu platform creates a documentList from a documentListType.  A documentList that is directly created cannot specify a documentListType. This field is therefore read-only. |  [optional] |
|**metadata** | **Object** | Allows arbitrary data to be stored on the documentList.  If the documentList is based on a documentListType, then this value will be derived from the documentListType, but can be overridden on update. |  [optional] |
