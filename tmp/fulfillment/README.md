## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven (3.8.3+)/Gradle (7.2+)

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.kibocommerce</groupId>
  <artifactId>fulfillment</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()     // Needed if the 'fulfillment' jar has been published to maven central.
    mavenLocal()       // Needed if the 'fulfillment' jar has been published to the local maven repo.
  }

  dependencies {
     implementation "com.kibocommerce:fulfillment:1.0.0"
  }
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/fulfillment-1.0.0.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

// Import classes:
import com.kibocommerce.sdk.fulfillment.ApiClient;
import com.kibocommerce.sdk.fulfillment.ApiException;
import com.kibocommerce.sdk.fulfillment.Configuration;
import com.kibocommerce.sdk.fulfillment.auth.*;
import com.kibocommerce.sdk.fulfillment.models.*;
import com.kibocommerce.sdk.fulfillment.api.CustomerSurveyApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("http://https:/api");
    
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: bearerAuth
    HttpBearerAuth bearerAuth = (HttpBearerAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("bearerAuth");
    bearerAuth.setBearerToken("BEARER TOKEN");

    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: clientOauth2
    OAuth clientOauth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("clientOauth2");
    clientOauth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    CustomerSurveyApi apiInstance = new CustomerSurveyApi(defaultClient);
    Integer shipmentNumber = 56; // Integer | shipmentNumber
    CustomerSurvey customerSurvey = new CustomerSurvey(); // CustomerSurvey | 
    try {
      EntityModelOfCustomerSurvey result = apiInstance.createSurveyUsingPOST(shipmentNumber, customerSurvey);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling CustomerSurveyApi#createSurveyUsingPOST");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

```
